To execute the `run.py` Python script with the `example` parameter, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the `run.py` script is located. You can use the `cd` command to change directories.
3. Once you are in the correct directory, run the following command:

    ```bash
    python run.py example
    ```

    Replace `example` with the name of the file from the `data` folder that you want to use as a parameter.

This will execute the `run.py` script with the specified parameter. Make sure that the `run.py` script and the `data` folder are in the same directory.
